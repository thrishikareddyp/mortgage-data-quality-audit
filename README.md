# Mortgage Data Quality Audit

This project performs a data quality audit on mortgage loan application data using Python and Pandas. It identifies common issues such as missing values, outliers, and logically inconsistent entries core steps in preparing financial data for analysis and reporting.

## 🔍 What This Project Does

- Identifies missing values in key fields like credit amount, annuity, and goods price
- Detects invalid or extreme values (e.g., negative income, unrealistic employment duration)
- Flags records with multiple quality issues for further review or exclusion

## 💡 Why This Project

Coming from a background working with healthcare data, I frequently validated claims records and patient outcomes to ensure reporting accuracy. This project shows how those same data integrity principles can be applied in the finance domain—especially in contexts involving risk-sensitive or regulated data.
